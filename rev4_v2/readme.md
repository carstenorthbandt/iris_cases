This file generates the 3d-printable parts for an Iris Rev 4 case.

The full case includes:

- Bottom lid with insets to glue in magnets (10mm diameter, 3mm height) and alignment pods for the lighting layer
- Lighting layer
- Upper case
- Template for cutting foam
- Tenting feet

What you need:
- 10 Screws (M2x16 self-tapping)
- White foam layer to go on either side of the lighting layer, 1.7-2mm thick
- Rubber or some other anti-slip pads

Construction:
- Print all parts, start with the cutting template
    - The top is meant to be printed upside down, supports are included and should not be generated by your slicer
    - The lighting layer needs transparent filament
    - Infill is not critical
    - Layer height is not critical
- Glue magnets into bottom lid
- Cut foam pads using template
- Stamp holes into foam pads using the template
    - There are two kinds of foam pads, upper and lower
    - The upper ones needs the holes for LEDs and screws only
    - The lower pads need the holes for screws, alignment pods, and magnets
- Cut and glue spacers/dampeners to go on the switch side of the PCB, between the PCB and the top case; off-cuts from the white foam work great
- Assemble the sandwich, screw hand-tight

IMPORTANT: Unless you modify the case, the reset switch is not accessible once assembled. My keyboards all run firmware that allows me to go into 
flash mode from pressing the four innermost thumb keys simultaneously regardless of layer or keymap.
